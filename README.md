# Discussions & feedback

This repository is meant to be the central place where topics that are broader
than a single repository can be discussed publicly. Everyone interested in the
Consortium for Python Data API Standards is invited to ask questions, air
concerns and suggest topics to cover or actions to take.

For topics that would best fit a forum or mailing list style discussion,
please use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/data-apis/consortium-feedback/discussions)
tab on this repository.
